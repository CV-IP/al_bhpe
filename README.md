# Active Learning for Bayesian 3D Hand Pose Estimation

## Proposed pipeline
![alt text](https://github.com/razvancaramalau/al_bhpe/blob/master/pipeline.png?raw=true)


The code requires pre-processed hand detected and cropped images for the 3D Hand Pose Dataset: ICVL, NYU, BigHand2.2;
This should be place in the "data/source/" directory 
The pre-processed dataset can be made available upon request(r.caramalau18@imperial.ac.uk).

Before running, please check and tune the parameters in the config.py file and at the beginning of the main.py function.
