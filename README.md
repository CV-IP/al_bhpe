# Active Learning for Bayesian 3D Hand Pose Estimation

The code requires pre-processed hand detected and cropped images for the 3D Hand Pose Dataset: ICVL, NYU, BigHand2.2;
This should be place in the "data/source/" directory 
The pre-processed dataset can be made available upon request.
Before running, please check and tune the parameters in the config.py file and at the beginning of the main.py function.
